# Electronic Store Sales Project Repository


**Part of series of projects to build my portfolio and practice the skills I learned.**

In this project, I generated a fake data sets representing the sales of an online electronic store during 2020, then I started the process of cleaning and exploring data before finally trying to answer some business related questions.


Project stages:
* Data generation with python code and trying to simulate 2020 sales.
* Exporting and importing the data into different Jupyter notebook to start analysis.
* Data exploring, cleaning and restructuring the data ( using string functions, Datetime library).
* Finally, answering some business questions about sales and products


Tools: Jupyter notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Datetime and Random libraries.

*Project is inspired from Keith Galli's Youtube channel. I just added some changes and used it as a practice project.
